  # I.T. Club 
  ### So I got asked to be the I.T. Club project manager...
Since I tend to do a lot of mad scientisting ( because im  nutz) I was asked to do the project managment stuff...
Man...they gonna find out, that the phrase " But why.... which will result in a resounding.... "because I can"

So, not sure what I would start with... 
So I guess I hit them with honesty and be willing to listen to input( maybe not to much honesty... I didn't get all these messed
up teeth becaause of my charming personality
